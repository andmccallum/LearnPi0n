Pi04 Engine Detailed System Test Analysis
=========================================

Test Description:
-----------------
The Pi04 engine underwent a rigorous hard load test with injection of quantum chaos and external chaos,
including out-of-scale variant energy scenarios. The simulation aimed to analyze how the system balances
internal states under quantum effects (quantum phase fluctuations, quantum noise) and external disturbances
(chaotic bursts, high amplitude noise).

Internal Mechanism:
-------------------
1. The internal state simulates quantum effects through oscillatory functions with phase shifts
   and decaying quantum noise:
   I(t) = sin(2πt + φ) + cos(4πt + φ) + N_q(t)
   where N_q(t) ~ Gaussian(0, 0.4) * exp(-t/50)

2. External chaos injection involves extremely volatile signals:
   E(t) = sin(3πt) + cos(2πt) + Chaos_Burst(t) + N_e(t)
   Chaos_Burst(t) is a random high amplitude burst (occurring with 5% probability)
   N_e(t) is high amplitude Gaussian noise modulated by a tanh function.

Combined System Balancing:
--------------------------
The system response is modeled by a non-linear balance operator defined as:
   balance_factor = tanh(|I(t)|) * exp(-|E(t)|/5)
   Combined Response = I(t) * (1 - balance_factor) + E(t) * balance_factor

Harmonic Analysis:
------------------
An advanced harmonic analyzer (in 12 dimensions) computes a harmonic model:
   Harmonic Model = Sum[i=1 to 12] [ A_i * sin(2πf_i t + φ_i) ]
The correlation between the combined response and the harmonic model is calculated to assess
harmonic balance under chaos injection.

Results:
--------
Advanced harmonic balance correlation: -0.05739161615234751
