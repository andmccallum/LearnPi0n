Alerts Detected:
---------------
Dimension 1: 102.93 exceeds threshold 55
Dimension 2: 103.17 exceeds threshold 60
Dimension 3: 104.62 exceeds threshold 65
Dimension 4: 104.60 exceeds threshold 70
Dimension 5: 104.93 exceeds threshold 75
Dimension 6: 104.78 exceeds threshold 80
Dimension 7: 105.51 exceeds threshold 85
Dimension 8: 104.13 exceeds threshold 90
Dimension 9: 106.66 exceeds threshold 95

Dimension 11: 106.85 exceeds threshold 105

Test Summary:
-------------
The comprehensive test simulated chaos and brute data fluctuations across all tested dimensions. Critical thresholds were evaluated for each dimension. Some dimensions exceeded the safety thresholds, indicating areas that may require further stabilization and protective measures in a real-world Pi0 system implementation.
