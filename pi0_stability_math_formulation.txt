Pi0 Stability Mathematical Formulation
======================================

This document provides the formal mathematical definitions of the new Pi0 operators
designed to address stability issues identified in the stress test.

1. Channel Prioritization Operator (CPO)
----------------------------------------

Definition:
CPO: C → [0,1]

For any channel c ∈ C:
CPO(c) = α * T(c) + β * R(c) + γ * RT⁻¹(c)

Where:
- C is the set of all channels
- T: C → [0,1] is the normalized throughput function
- R: C → [0,1] is the reliability function
- RT⁻¹: C → [0,1] is the inverse recovery time function (faster = higher)
- α, β, γ ∈ [0,1] are weighting coefficients such that α + β + γ = 1

Properties:
- Monotonicity: If T(c₁) ≥ T(c₂), R(c₁) ≥ R(c₂), and RT⁻¹(c₁) ≥ RT⁻¹(c₂), then CPO(c₁) ≥ CPO(c₂)
- Bounded: ∀c ∈ C, 0 ≤ CPO(c) ≤ 1
- Weighted: The importance of throughput, reliability, and recovery time can be adjusted via α, β, γ

2. Graceful Degradation Operator (GDO)
--------------------------------------

Definition:
GDO: P(C) × [0,1] → P(C)

For any subset S ⊆ C and load threshold L ∈ [0,1]:
GDO(S, L) = {c ∈ S | CPO(c) < L}

Where:
- P(C) is the power set of C (set of all subsets)
- L is the load threshold

Properties:
- Threshold-based: Only channels with priority below L are included
- Subset: GDO(S, L) ⊆ S for any S and L
- Monotonicity in L: If L₁ ≤ L₂, then GDO(S, L₁) ⊆ GDO(S, L₂)
- Empty at L=0: GDO(S, 0) = ∅ for any S

3. Buffer Allocation Operator (BAO)
-----------------------------------

Definition:
BAO: C × ℝ⁺ → ℝ⁺

For any channel c ∈ C and total buffer B ∈ ℝ⁺:
BAO(c, B) = min(B_max, B * CPO(c) / max_{c' ∈ C} CPO(c'))

Where:
- B_max is the maximum buffer size for any channel
- max_{c' ∈ C} CPO(c') is the maximum CPO value across all channels

Properties:
- Bounded: ∀c ∈ C, 0 ≤ BAO(c, B) ≤ B_max
- Proportional: Higher priority channels receive proportionally more buffer
- Conservation: ∑_{c ∈ C} BAO(c, B) ≤ B
- Maximum utilization: The channel with highest CPO gets the maximum allocation (up to B_max)

4. Stability Assurance Operator (SAO)
-------------------------------------

Definition:
SAO: P(C) → [0,1]

For any subset S ⊆ C:
SAO(S) = ∏_{c ∈ S} (1 - FP(c))

Where:
- FP: C → [0,1] is the failure probability function

Properties:
- Bounded: 0 ≤ SAO(S) ≤ 1
- Monotonicity: If S₁ ⊆ S₂, then SAO(S₁) ≥ SAO(S₂)
- Perfect stability: SAO(S) = 1 if and only if FP(c) = 0 for all c ∈ S
- Composition: SAO(S₁ ∪ S₂) = SAO(S₁) * SAO(S₂) if S₁ and S₂ are independent

5. Composite System Stability Metric (CSSM)
-------------------------------------------

Definition:
CSSM: P(C) × ℝ⁺ → [0,1]

For any subset S ⊆ C and total buffer B ∈ ℝ⁺:
CSSM(S, B) = SAO(S) * (1 - e^(-λ * ∑_{c ∈ S} BAO(c, B)))

Where:
- λ is a scaling factor for buffer effectiveness

Properties:
- Bounded: 0 ≤ CSSM(S, B) ≤ 1
- Increases with stability: Higher SAO(S) leads to higher CSSM
- Increases with buffer: More buffer allocation leads to higher CSSM
- Diminishing returns: The effect of additional buffer follows a diminishing returns curve

6. Optimal Channel Subset Selection
----------------------------------

Problem:
Given a set C of channels, a load threshold L, and a total buffer B, find the subset S* ⊆ C that maximizes CSSM while ensuring all critical functions are maintained.

Formulation:
S* = argmax_{S ⊆ C} CSSM(S, B)
subject to:
- Critical(S) = true (all critical functions are covered)
- |S| ≤ N_max (maximum number of active channels)
- ∀c ∈ S, CPO(c) ≥ L (all active channels meet minimum priority)

Where:
- Critical: P(C) → {true, false} indicates whether all critical functions are covered
- N_max is the maximum number of channels that can be active simultaneously

7. Dynamic Stability Control
---------------------------

The dynamic control of system stability can be modeled as a discrete-time system:

S(t+1) = S(t) - GDO(S(t), L(t)) + R(t)
B(t+1) = B_total - ∑_{c ∈ S(t+1)} BAO(c, B_total)

Where:
- S(t) is the set of active channels at time t
- L(t) is the load threshold at time t
- R(t) is the set of recovered channels at time t
- B(t) is the remaining unallocated buffer at time t
- B_total is the total system buffer

The control objective is to maximize:
∑_{t=0}^T CSSM(S(t), B_total)

subject to the dynamics above and the constraint that critical functions are always maintained.
