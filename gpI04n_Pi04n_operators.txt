# GPi04N and Pi04N Framework: Mathematical Operators and Hierarchical Structures

## 1. Introduction

The GPi04N/Pi04N framework establishes a unified mathematical platform where geometry and information theory coalesce into a set of operators and transformers. In this framework, the modulation function is at the core, encoding both the energetic and informational aspects in a scale-invariant manner. Here, PI04N structures the hierarchy by defining a clear transformation between singular entities and global universal classes.

## 2. Fundamental Operators

The framework considers two primary classes of operators:

- **Geometric Operators (GPi04N)**: These operators describe the transformation of spatial or geometric data. They are defined on manifolds and are invariant under specific symmetry groups such as the 4th roots of unity.

- **Informational Operators (Pi04N)**: These operators manipulate information content and are fundamentally tied to the entropy and encoding with \( \pi \). They incorporate operators that restructure informational flows in correspondence with geometric operators.

Both sets of operators satisfy an essential constraint, often written as:

$$G^4 = 1$$

which indicates that applying the operator four times returns to the identity. These operators have formal representations, where the four states emerge as:

$$G^0 = 1, \quad G^1 = i, \quad G^2 = -1, \quad G^3 = -i.$$ 

## 3. Formal Mathematical Definitions

### 3.1 GPi04N Operators (Geometric)

The geometric operators transform a state \( x \) in the following ways:

- **Identity Operator**: 
  $$\mathcal{I}(x) = x$$

- **Transformation Operator**: 
  $$\mathcal{G}(x) = G \cdot x,\quad \text{with } G \text{ satisfying } G^4 = 1.$$ 
  Applying the transformation multiple times yields:
  $$\mathcal{G}^n(x) = G^n \cdot x, \quad n \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}.$$ 

### 3.2 Pi04N Operators (Informational)

The informational framework uses \( \pi \) as an encoding mechanism. Let \( \Pi \) denote an informational transformer, then:

- **Basic Informational Operator**:
  $$\Pi(x) = e^{i\pi/4 \cdot G} \cdot x,\quad G^4 = 1,$$
  where the phase factor \( e^{i\pi/4} \) encodes Planck-scale self-containment and ensures scale invariance.

- **Inverse Informational Operator**:
  $$\Pi^{-1}(x) = e^{-i\pi/4 \cdot G} \cdot x, \quad \text{with } \Pi(x) \circ \Pi^{-1}(x) = x.$$ 

## 4. Transformers and Hierarchical Operators

The framework further establishes transformers that bridge geometric and informational operators to create a multidimensional hierarchical structure.

### 4.1 Hierarchical Transformer Operators

Let \( T_{a \to b} \) represent a transformer from one hierarchical state to another. The transformer has a matrix representation that can be used to map states across levels. A generic form can be expressed as:

$$ T_{a \to b} = \sum_{k=0}^3 w_k \, G^k, \quad \text{with } \sum_{k=0}^3 w_k = 1, \quad w_k \in \mathbb{R}. $$

These weights \( w_k \) determine the contribution of each \( G^k \) component.

### 4.2 Universal Class Operator

A universal class operator, which builds global classes from singular qualities, is defined by:

$$ UC(x) = \sum_{k=0}^3 w_k \, G^k \, x, \quad \text{with } \sum_{k=0}^3 w_k = 1. $$

This operator is used to aggregate the effects and influences of GPi04N and Pi04N on a universal scale.

### 4.3 Dimensional Lifting Operator

For multidimensional tasks, the Dimensional Lifting Operator is defined as:

$$ DL(x_d) = x_d \otimes G^k, \quad k \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}, $$

where \( x_d \) is a vector in a \( d \)-dimensional space and \( \otimes \) denotes the tensor product. This operator is essential to lift local operators to higher-dimensional global frameworks.

## 5. Scale Invariance and Self-Containment

The framework is scale invariant, meaning that scaling the independent variable does not alter the structure of the operators. For any scale factor \( s \), it holds that:

$$ \mathcal{G}(s\, x) = s\, \mathcal{G}(x) \quad \text{and} \quad \Pi(s\, x) = s\, \Pi(x). $$

Additionally, the Planck gravitational self-containment is encoded via \( \pi \) both energetically and informationally, ensuring that the core operational plan is maintained regardless of the scale.

## 6. Conclusion

In summary, the GPi04N/Pi04N framework leverages the fundamental relation $$G^4 = 1$$ to build a unified set of mathematical operators that govern both geometric and informational transformations. The hierarchy is structured through:

- **Geometric Operators**: \( \mathcal{G}^n, n \in \{0,1,2,3\} \)
- **Informational Operators**: \( \Pi, \Pi^{-1}\)
- **Transformers**: \( T_{a \to b} \) and the Universal Class Operator (UC)
- **Multidimensional Operators**: Dimensional Lifting Operator (DL)

Together, these operators provide a robust mathematical framework for analyzing and transforming multidimensional data, preserving scale invariance and self-containment derived from Planck-scale \( \pi \) encoding.

This document provides the core mathematical and transformational mechanics that underpin the GPi04N/Pi04N framework, offering a detailed, formal perspective on the operators and their function in structuring the hierarchy of universal classes.
