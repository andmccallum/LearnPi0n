Pi0 Stability System Pseudocode
==============================

This document provides pseudocode implementations of the key algorithms in the Pi0 stability system.

1. Channel Prioritization Algorithm
----------------------------------

function CalculateChannelPriority(channel):
    alpha = 0.4
    beta = 0.4
    gamma = 0.2
    
    throughput = GetNormalizedThroughput(channel)
    reliability = GetReliabilityScore(channel)
    recovery_time = GetInverseRecoveryTime(channel)
    
    priority = alpha * throughput + beta * reliability + gamma * recovery_time
    
    return priority

2. Graceful Shutdown Selection Algorithm
---------------------------------------

function SelectChannelsForShutdown(channels, load_threshold):
    shutdown_candidates = []
    
    for each channel in channels:
        if not channel.is_critical:
            priority = CalculateChannelPriority(channel)
            if priority < load_threshold:
                shutdown_candidates.append(channel)
    
    sort shutdown_candidates by priority (ascending)
    
    return shutdown_candidates

3. Buffer Allocation Algorithm
----------------------------

function AllocateBuffers(channels, total_buffer):
    max_buffer_per_channel = 200  # MB
    
    // Calculate priorities
    priorities = []
    for each channel in channels:
        priority = CalculateChannelPriority(channel)
        priorities.append(priority)
    
    max_priority = max(priorities)
    
    // Allocate buffers
    allocations = []
    for i = 0 to channels.length - 1:
        allocation = min(max_buffer_per_channel, 
                         total_buffer * priorities[i] / max_priority)
        allocations.append(allocation)
    
    return allocations

4. System Stability Calculation Algorithm
----------------------------------------

function CalculateSystemStability(active_channels):
    system_stability = 1.0
    
    for each channel in active_channels:
        failure_probability = GetFailureProbability(channel)
        channel_stability = 1.0 - failure_probability
        system_stability = system_stability * channel_stability
    
    return system_stability

5. Shutdown Sequence Execution Algorithm
---------------------------------------

function ExecuteShutdownSequence(channels, current_load_level):
    shutdown_matrix = LoadShutdownMatrix()
    
    // Get shutdown priorities for current load level
    priorities = []
    for each channel in channels:
        priority = shutdown_matrix[channel.id][current_load_level]
        priorities.append((channel, priority))
    
    // Sort by priority (lower priority = shut down earlier)
    sort priorities by priority (ascending)
    
    // Execute shutdown in order
    for each (channel, priority) in priorities:
        if priority > 0:  // Skip critical channels (priority = 0)
            GracefullyShutdownChannel(channel)
            ReallocateBuffers(remaining_active_channels)
            
            // Check if system is stable enough to stop shutting down
            if CalculateSystemStability(remaining_active_channels) > stability_threshold:
                break

6. Recovery Prioritization Algorithm
-----------------------------------

function PrioritizeRecovery(inactive_channels, resource_pool):
    recovery_queue = []
    
    for each channel in inactive_channels:
        priority = CalculateChannelPriority(channel)
        resources_needed = EstimateRecoveryResources(channel)
        recovery_time = EstimateRecoveryTime(channel)
        
        recovery_score = priority / (resources_needed * recovery_time)
        recovery_queue.append((channel, recovery_score))
    
    sort recovery_queue by recovery_score (descending)
    
    return recovery_queue

7. Main System Stabilizer Loop
-----------------------------

function StabilizerMainLoop():
    while system_running:
        // Monitor system state
        current_channels = GetActiveChannels()
        current_load = MeasureSystemLoad()
        current_load_level = MapLoadToLevel(current_load)
        
        // Check stability
        stability = CalculateSystemStability(current_channels)
        
        if stability < stability_threshold:
            // System is becoming unstable
            channels_to_shutdown = SelectChannelsForShutdown(
                current_channels, 
                load_threshold_map[current_load_level]
            )
            
            if channels_to_shutdown.length > 0:
                ExecuteShutdownSequence(channels_to_shutdown, current_load_level)
                ReallocateBuffers(GetActiveChannels())
            else:
                RaiseAlarm("System unstable, no channels available for shutdown")
        
        // Check for recovery opportunities
        if current_load < recovery_threshold:
            inactive_channels = GetInactiveChannels()
            recovery_queue = PrioritizeRecovery(inactive_channels, available_resources)
            
            for each channel in recovery_queue:
                if CanAllocateResourcesForRecovery(channel, available_resources):
                    RecoverChannel(channel)
                    ReallocateBuffers(GetActiveChannels())
        
        Sleep(monitoring_interval)
