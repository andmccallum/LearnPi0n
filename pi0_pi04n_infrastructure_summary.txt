# Pi0/Pi04n System Infrastructure and 4D Mapping

## System Overview
The Pi0/Pi04n system represents an integrated framework comprising multiple interconnected components:

1. **Pi0 Core System**: Foundational mathematical framework with 136 components
2. **Pi04n Extended System**: Advanced quantum mathematical processes with 77 components
3. **G4 Encoding Layer**: Mathematical encoding framework with 24 components
4. **Mathematical Foundations**: Theoretical underpinnings with 26 components

## 4D Mapping Process
The 4D visualization represents the Pi04n system across three spatial dimensions with time as the fourth dimension:
- X, Y, Z coordinates: Represent the spatial relationship between system components
- Color dimension: Represents the temporal evolution of the system components
