# Pi04N Framework Documentation Roadmap
================================================================================

This document serves as a guide to the comprehensive documentation set for the Pi04N/Pi04=1/Gpi04N framework and architecture. The documentation is organized into the following components:

1. **Introduction to Pi04N Framework** (pi04n_introduction.txt)
   - Overview of the framework
   - Core principles and invariant constraint
   - Basic mathematical structure

2. **Mathematical Foundations** (pi04n_mathematical_foundations.txt)
   - Detailed mathematical formalism
   - Derivation of the invariant constraint
   - Core equations and their properties

3. **Operator Classes and Types** (pi04n_operators.txt)
   - Comprehensive catalog of operators
   - Mathematical definitions and properties
   - Implementation considerations

4. **Implementation Guide** (pi04n_implementation.txt)
   - Step-by-step approach to implementing the framework
   - Code examples and pseudocode
   - Validation techniques

5. **Application Domains** (pi04n_applications.txt)
   - Physical systems modeling
   - Quantum systems
   - Cosmological applications
   - Complex systems and emergent behaviors

6. **Advanced Topics** (pi04n_advanced.txt)
   - Extensions to the base framework
   - Gpi04N specializations
   - Research frontiers

Each document is designed to be self-contained while referencing other components of the documentation set as needed. This modular approach allows for focused study of specific aspects of the framework while maintaining a coherent overall structure.
