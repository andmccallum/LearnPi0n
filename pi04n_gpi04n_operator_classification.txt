-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. APPLICATIONS AND EXAMPLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 Spherical Storage with Triangular Encoding:

    The state function for a spherical storage region with an inner triangular
    encoding area can be represented as:

    Ψ(r,θ,φ,t) = ∑_{l,m} a_{l,m}(t) · Y_{l,m}(θ,φ) + ∑_{j=1}^3 b_j(t) · T_j(r,θ,φ)

    where:
    - a_{l,m}(t) are time-dependent coefficients for spherical harmonics
    - Y_{l,m}(θ,φ) are spherical harmonic functions
    - b_j(t) are time-dependent coefficients for triangular basis functions
    - T_j(r,θ,φ) are triangular basis functions

6.2 PI04N Hierarchy with Open/Closed Sides:

    The boundary conditions for the PI04N hierarchy with two open and two closed
    sides can be represented as:

    B_open(Ψ)|_{θ=0,π} = G · ∂Ψ/∂θ|_{θ=0,π}
    B_closed(Ψ)|_{θ=π/2,3π/2} = 0

    This ensures that information flows only through the open sides and is
    blocked at the closed sides.

6.3 Information Transport through Harmonic Resonance:

    The transport of information through harmonic resonance can be represented
    by the action of the unified transformation operator:

    Ψ(r,θ,t+Δt) = U(G,Ψ(r,θ,t)) = e^{iG·Δt} · Ψ(r,θ,t)

    This transformation preserves the G^4=1 condition while allowing information
    to propagate through the system.

6.4 Scaling Operations for Hierarchical Processing:

    Scaling operations that allow the system to grow or shrink can be represented
    by the composite scaling operator:

    C_scale(α,β,Ψ) = α · Ψ + β · ∂Ψ/∂t

    where:
    - α controls spatial scaling
    - β controls temporal scaling

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. CONCLUSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PI04N/GPI04N operator framework provides a powerful mathematical structure
for describing harmonic oscillators, information storage, and transport mechanisms.
The classification and hierarchy of operators presented in this document enable
the construction of complex systems with specific properties, such as the
spherical storage area with triangular encoding and the PI04N hierarchy with
selective access through open and closed sides.

The unified gravitational equation, rooted in the G^4=1 condition, serves as the
foundation for all operators and ensures that they relate to each other through
consistent transformation rules. This framework can be applied to a wide range
of problems in information theory, quantum mechanics, and gravitational physics.
