Unified Function Analysis:

We consider the unified gravitational equation:

    $\( \mathcal{G}_{\pi}^{(0)}(\lambda) = e^{i\lambda G^4} \cdot \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} rac{G^p}{p} \cdot \sin(p\lambda) + \pi\Phi(\lambda) + C_0 \)$

This equation unifies the previously separated terms into one coherent expression by explicitly incorporating the parameter \(\lambda\) as a central modulator. The main components are:

1. \(e^{i\lambda G^4}\):
   - This complex exponential term captures the cyclic symmetry inherent in the fourth root of unity \(G^4\).
   - By associating \(\lambda\) with \(G^4\), it reflects rotational or phase-like behavior that underpins gravitational interactions in discrete cyclic groups.

2. \(\sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} rac{G^p}{p} \cdot \sin(p\lambda)\):
   - The summation over prime numbers (\(p \in \mathbb{P}\)) encapsulates the extension to various gravitational dimensions, here represented by \(G^p\) where different primes serve as proxies for distinct dimensional influences.
   - The division by \(p\) and the sine function \(\sin(p\lambda)\) modulate each prime's contribution, effectively turning them into harmonic components in a prime frequency spectrum.
   - This term elegantly integrates the role of prime numbers by considering their cumulative influence across a spectrum of gravitational modes.

3. \(\pi\Phi(\lambda)\):
   - This term represents a scalar field \(\Phi\) modulated by the constant \(\pi\). 
   - It corresponds to internal field dynamics whose behavior is influenced by \(\lambda\), thereby coupling field oscillations with geometric properties.

4. \(C_0\):
   - A constant that sets the baseline or reference state for the entire gravitational system.
   - It anchors the equation in a fundamental reference frame, crucial for a consistent theory of quantum gravity.

In summary, by incorporating \(\lambda\) explicitly, the unified equation links cyclical symmetry, multidimensional gravitational influences, and field dynamics into a single coherent expression. This formulation is preferable over the earlier set notation because it encapsulates all interactions and modulations in one equation, offering clearer insight into the interplay between discrete symmetry (through \(G^4\)), prime-based dimensional contributions (via the summation), and continuous field variations (via \(\pi\Phi(\lambda)\)).

The central role of \(\lambda\) ensures that the evolution and modulation of the entire system are captured directly in the equation, making it an ideal candidate for analyzing quantum gravitational interactions within the framework of the PI04N principle.
