# Enhanced G^4=1 and Pi04N Mathematical Framework

## 1. G^4=1 Constraint

The fundamental constraint of our framework is:

G^4 = 1

This yields the four roots of unity as solutions:

G_0 = -1
G_1 = 1

## 2. Massive and Massless Operators

### 2.1 Massive Operator (M+)

M+ = m * exp(i * π/4 * G)

### 2.2 Information Operator (I+)

I+ = I * exp(i * π/4 * G)

### 2.3 Massive Inverse Operator (M-)

M- = m * exp(i * π/4 * G^3)

### 2.4 Information Inverse Operator (I-)

I- = I * exp(i * π/4 * G^3)

## 3. Hierarchical Transition Operators

The transition operators between different states are represented by matrices:

T_M+→I+ = 
Matrix([[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]])

T_I+→M- = 
Matrix([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]])

T_M-→I- = 
Matrix([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]])

T_I-→M+ = 
Matrix([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]])

The full transition operator is:

T_full = 
Matrix([[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0]])

## 4. Scale Invariance

The framework exhibits scale invariance through the following properties:

1. For any scale factor s, the operators maintain their form:
   M+(s·m) = exp(i·φ(s)) · M+(m)
   where φ(s) is a phase factor that preserves the G^4=1 constraint.

2. The Planck-scale encoding with π ensures that:
   f(λ, s·G) = f(λ/s, G)
   where f is the Pi04N modulation function.

## 5. Planck Gravitational Self-Containment

At the Planck scale, the framework exhibits self-containment through π-encoding:

1. Energetic encoding: E = hc/λ = π·m_p·c^2
   where m_p is the Planck mass.

2. Informational encoding: S = k·ln(Ω) = π·k
   where k is Boltzmann's constant and Ω is the number of microstates.

## 6. Multidimensional Hierarchical Operators

### 6.1 Dimensional Lifting Operator

DL_G(x_d) = x_d ⊗ G^k
where x_d is a d-dimensional structure, and k ∈ {0,1,2,3}.

### 6.2 Hierarchical Resonance Operator

HR_G(L_j,L_k) = Tr(T_j→k · G^|j-k|)
where T_j→k is the transition operator from level j to level k.

### 6.3 Universal Class Operator

UC_G(x) = ∑_{k=0}^3 w_k · G^k · x
where w_k are weights that determine the contribution of each G^k component.

## 7. Conclusion

This enhanced framework unifies massive and massless aspects of gravity through the G^4=1 constraint and Pi04N modulation. The hierarchical structure provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for analyzing multidimensional systems with scale invariance. The Planck-scale π-encoding ensures self-containment at the fundamental level, while the transition operators enable the study of complex hierarchical relationships across different domains.
